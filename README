WWW-Bleep version 0.92
======================

A fairly simple module that allows you to skim Bleep.com for various
information.  In combination with a simple database this can make 
cataloging many of your records much much easier!

Currently no general searching is configured.  Nor is any sort of cart
handling...  Goto the site directly if you want that for now.
